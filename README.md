The code contained in this repository was used to apply transductive learning techniques on our Android Malware dataset. 
In this work, we compared k Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and three transductive 
techniques: Label Spreading, Label Propagation, and a variant.
We utilized [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) packages 
for [k-NN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html?highlight=k%20neighbors%20classifier#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier),
[Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB),
[Label Spreading](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading.html?highlight=label%20spreading#sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading),
and [Label Propogation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelPropagation.html#sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelPropagation).

For the variant, we created a hybrid of label spreading and label propogation which is contained in the label_propogation.py file. 
This code was utilized for the paper [Identifying Android malware using network-based approaches](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341161.3343534).
Details of the variant can be found in that publication. 

Testing for this work was done on Kansas State University's [Beocat](https://beocat.ksu.edu) as well as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com). 
The file 50000_hc_knn.sh is a sample shell file that was used for running the code on KSU's Beocat.
